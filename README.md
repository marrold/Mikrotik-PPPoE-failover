Mikrotik-PPPoE-failover
=======================

This project is a failover script for PPPoE based connections on Mikrotik devices. It senses degraded internet service, and adjusts the routes accordingly.

Instructions for use
--------------------

There is currently only one variable that needs adjusting, '$iface'. This should be set to the interface name you want to monitor and adjust route distances for accordingly.
